 Minimising The Energy of Charged Particle Configurations on a Circular Surface by Means of Simulated Annealing
---------

Finding the minimum energy configuration for multiple electrons confined to a 
circle can't be solve analytical. Numerical methods such the Simulated Annealing 
allow through their heuristic approach to find an optimum minimum energy configuration.
